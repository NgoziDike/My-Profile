# My-Profile
👋Hi my name is Ngozi.

😊I’m a curious and data-driven professional with 1+ year of experience as a Data Analyst, passionate about turning numbers into meaningful stories. I’ve worked closely with teams across different departments to help them understand their data, spot trends, and make smarter decisions. Whether it's digging into SQL databases, building dashboards in Power BI, or running analyses in Googlesheet, I enjoy finding patterns and uncovering insights that drive real business impact. I take pride in simplifying complex data for non-technical audiences and love those “aha” moments when the data truly clicks with people.

👥Let’s connect, brainstorm, and support each other to bring out the best in this project. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and building something great together!

Let’s connect and create together!
